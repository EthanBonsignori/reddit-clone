# cReddit - Reddit Clone

cReddit is an app that seeks to clone (new) reddit's homepage using React and Chakra UI. The reason I am creating this app is to learn new frameworks along the way. While creating cReddit, I am teaching myself Typescript, GraphQL, Typeorm, Apollo, Chakra UI, and more. It's a sort of trial by fire!

Check back soon for a deployed link.
